# This script waits for buildkit to finish ongoing build processes before exiting.
#
# It is intended to be used as a pre-stop script in a container that runs buildkit.
# This helps us workaround the issue where buildkit does not allow ongoing builds to
# finish when the container receives a SIGTERM signal: https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/4090.
#
# The script works by periodically checking whether any buildx clients are connected
# to buildkitd. If we see an established connection, we assume that there's an ongoing
# build process, so we wait a bit and check again. Once we don't see any established
# connections for a certain number of consecutive checks, we assume that all builds
# have stopped and exit the script, indicating that it's safe to stop the container.
# Because this is a somewhat naive approach that only looks at individual points in time,
# we will check multiple times just to be sure that we're not missing any builds.

# Variables (change these as needed)
CHECK_FREQUENCY_MS=500                      # How often we should for running build processes (in milliseconds)
WAIT_UNTIL_NO_BUILDS_SEEN_FOR_X_SECONDS=10  # If no build processes are seen for this many seconds, we assume that all builds have stopped
